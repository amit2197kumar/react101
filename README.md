# E11. Data Is The New Oil

## Learning
- `UI Layer`Â VsÂ `Data Layer`
- Revised State vs Props
- `Props Driling`
- `Lifting State Up`
    - Create Accordion
    - Create Closing Accordion (Bad Coding Approach)
    - Create Closing Accordion (Good Coding Approach)
- Chrome Extension -Â `React Development Tool`:-
    - `Components`
    - `Profiler`: Flamegraph, Ranked
- State Management:Â `React Context`,Â `Redux Store`,Â `NGRX`,`MobX`,`Flux`
- `React Context`:
    - Create Context (usingÂ `createContext()`)
    - Using Context (usingÂ `useContext`Â hook)
    - Using Context in class based component (usingÂ `<ContextName.Consumer>`)
    - Modify / Override Context (usingÂ `<ContextName.Provider value={}>`)
    - For DebuggingÂ `Context`Â in brower console, we can provideÂ *name*Â of contextÂ `ContextName.displayName = "Anyname"`

## Notes

**What is prop drilling?**

- `Prop drilling`Â is the process of passing data from one component via several interconnected components to the component that needs it.
- Prop drilling results in long and unclean code, and also there are greater possibilities for mistakes like renaming the props midway by mistake, refactoring some data's structure, props being forwarded more often than is necessary, using default props unfairly or using default props unfairly or insufficiently.
- By enclosing your state and data in a context provider, the Context API essentially allows you to transmit your state and data to numerous components. Afterward, it uses its value attribute to send this state to the context provider.

**More Details**

- Component composition is the process of putting together components like bricks to create a final product.
- There are two kinds of component composition :
    - container components and
    - specialized components

**What is lifting the state up?**

- When we want to pass some props from child component to parent or its siblings, we can useÂ `lifting up state`Â technique. It can be thought as if the control is handed over to the parent and let the child modify the data through the function that is passed to child as props. There is aÂ `single sourace of truth`Â maintained by the parent.
- Example :
    1. **Child -> Parent**Â : I have implemented this in my app for passing marked favourite restaurant card data to Body Component. Check code for implementation & coding-assignment.md for explanation.
    2. **Child -> Siblings**Â : I have implemented this in my app for displaying FAQ sections under Help.js for letting child know about the state of its siblings by lifting up the state to the closest ancestor parent. Check code for implementation & coding-assignment.md for explanation.

**What is Context Provider and Context Consumer?**

`React Context API`Â provides a way to pass data through multiple nested levels of components without having to manually pass that data to each level. It is a way of global state management.

Three steps of working with Conext :

1. Create the Context: Create usingÂ `createContext()`Â & Export context from a file (in utils folder)
2. Provide Context: Wrap the required components with aÂ `context provider`
3. Use the Context: ImportÂ `useContext`Â hook & the created context and create variable to store and use this context

`Context Provider`

- Every Context object comes with a Provider.
- Its a React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes.
- The Provider component accepts a value prop to be passed to consuming components that are descendants of this Provider. One Provider can be connected to many consumers. Providers can be nested to override values deeper within the tree.

`Context Consumer`

- BeforeÂ `useContext`Â existed, there was an older way to read context :Â `Context.Consumer`
    
    ```java
     function Button() {
      // ðŸŸ¡ Legacy way (not recommended)
     return (
      <ThemeContext.Consumer>
        {theme => (
          <button className={theme} />
        )}
      </ThemeContext.Consumer>
     );
     }
    ```

**If you donâ€™t pass a value to the provider does it take the default value?**

- No, default value is not passed as value to components. When we don't pass a value to the provider then React throws an error in that case.
- If we don't need to pass value then value={undefined} must be mentioned in provider.
- TheÂ `defaultValue`Â argument isÂ *only*Â used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it in the tree.

## Quick Revise

1. Data is the new oil

2. UI layer & Data layer

3. Data layer

   - states & props
   - state: local variable/ scope is only within a component
   - props: values passed from one component to another component

4. **Props Drilling** :- Passing props from one component to another which inturn passes to another component

   - Example:

   ```
   AppLayout -> state (user)
   pass as prop to Body
   Body ->
   pass as prop to Body
   RestaurantCard ->
   ```

5. **State Lifting** (Example of Accrodian & Closing Accordian)

6. **React Developer tool** [chrome extension]: For Debugging data layer:
      - Component (in browser console)
      - Profiler (in browser console)

7. Data layer:
   - props
   - State
   - Hooks
   - rendered by
   - source

- Data from child to parent ?

9. **Context**: for storing a data that we can used throughout application
      - why not global variable ?
         - Because react will not be able to track and trigger reconciliation
      - Create Context in `utils` folder
      - Creating Context
         - `createContext()`
      - Using Context:
         - `useContext` (hook)
      - Context Consumer: (using context in class based component)
         - `<<ContextName.Consumer>`
      - **Context Provider**
         - `<ContextName.Provider value={}>` (Modifing/Overriding)
      - To "Display Name" of context in brower console during debugging in React Developer extenion Tools use:
         - `ContextName.displayname = "Name of Context"`
